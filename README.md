TEXT ENCRYPTION USING VARIOUS ALGORITHMS
1. CEASER CIPHER AND AES ALONG WITH FLASK
A. INTRODUCTION:
   The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques used in cryptography.
   It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.
   This project demonstrates a secure communication system using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) implemented through a Flask-based web API.
    It allows clients to encrypt and decrypt messages by sending requests over HTTP to a server that performs the AES operations securely.

   AES is a widely used symmetric key encryption algorithm known for its speed and strength.
   Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, provides an easy way to expose the encryption functionality through RESTful API endpoints
   such as /encrypt and /decrypt.
